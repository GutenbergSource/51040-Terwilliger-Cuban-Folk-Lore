</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nowhere will one find such a mass of superstitious
customs practiced, as in Cuba; especially among the black and <i lang=
"es">mestizos</i>, and even the educated whites, while not admitting
their belief in witchcraft have a wholesome fear of the <i lang=
"es">Brujo</i> or witch doctor.</p>
<p>It is probable that most <span class="corr" id="xd26e139" title=
"Source: if">of</span> these queer practices were introduced by the
blacks who brought their strange beliefs from Africa. The belief in the
<i>Evil Spirit</i> was doubtless the result of their early contact with
the aboriginal Cubans, who worshipped the devil.</p>
<p><i lang="es">&Ntilde;a&ntilde;iguismo</i> is a form of superstition
in which Catholicism and witchcraft are mingled in bewildering
confusion.</p>
<p>The society of <i lang="es">&Ntilde;&aacute;&ntilde;igos</i> was
first introduced in Cuba in 1836 by a <i lang="es">cabildo</i> of the
<i lang="es">Carabal&iacute;</i> nation; many conjectures as to its
origin have been put forward, but it is most probable that a priest or
Chief of the African institution called <i lang=
"es">&Ntilde;anguitua</i>, was brought to Cuba as a slave and here
resumed his official character among his enslaved countrymen.</p>
<p>The first <i lang="es">Juego</i> or chapter was founded in Regla and
called the <i lang="es">Apapa Epi</i>; it was officially sanctioned and
<span class="corr" id="xd26e171" title=
"Source: licenced">licensed</span> by the government. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e174" href="#xd26e174" name=
"xd26e174">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>The African order disbelieved in God and the worship of idols and
<i lang="es">fetiches</i> prevailed: in fact was one of the principal
causes of the organization of the society. <i lang="es">Brujos</i> or
members of the order who were supposed to possess supernatural powers
were consulted in all cases of sickness. Slave holders claimed that
&ldquo;the <i lang="es">gente de naci&oacute;n</i> (imported slaves)
refused to be doctored by other means than their own <i lang=
"es">brujos</i> and corporal punishment was absolutely necessary to
overcome their stubbornness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Whites and even mulatoes were at first refused admission to the
society, but in 1863 a traitor to the original chapter sold for twenty
<span class="corr" id="xd26e191" title="Source: centenes">cents</span>
the secrets of the order to a society of white and mulatoes who by
means of the secret pass words and signs gained admittance to the hall
where an initiatory session was in progress and demanded that their
chapter be recognized by the head <i lang="es">Juego</i>. A severe
battle was the outcome of this high-handed manner of securing the
administration of the initiation rites, but eventually resulted in the
formation of the <i lang="es">Ocolio &Ntilde;&aacute;&ntilde;igos</i>,
an order in which whites and half castes were admitted.</p>
<p>Many catholic rites were introduced in the new order, which however
did not entirely displace their belief in their former idols.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">&Ntilde;&aacute;&ntilde;igos</i> about this time
began to assume a vicious character and soon became a serious menace to
society; the degenerate whites who became <i lang=
"es">&Ntilde;&aacute;&ntilde;igos</i> soon displaced the old negro
kings or chiefs and introduced many new customs, most of which were not
to be desired in a civilized country.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that the <span class="corr" id="xd26e212"
title="Source: avatisim">avatism</span> or reversion of half breeds
almost always result in excesses. Religious dances of an indecent
character were introduced and more revolting rites of <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e215" title="Source: iniciation">initiation</span>
installed.</p>
<p>Rivalry among the different chiefs sprung up and dissensions among
the various orders soon assumed a bloody aspect.</p>
<p>Sanguinary battles among the negros and half castes were common
every feast day and resulted in stringent laws being passed against the
entire organization.</p>
<p>After the entrance of whites and mulatoes in the different orders
the cross became one of the most important symbols of the order.</p>
<p>The great seal was used only by the head chapter at Regla, each
district having a different symbol. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e227" href="#xd26e227" name="xd26e227">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>All initiatory rites were performed by the chief of the district and
the Carabali tongue was used exclusively. The novice was marked on the
forehead with blood in the sign of the cross + on the breast <img src=
"images/p05-1.png" alt="+/o|o/+" width="35" height="29"> and on the
back <img src="images/p05-2.png" alt="o/o|o/o" width="34" height="28">
after which he was struck several times with the <i lang="es">palo
Mocongo</i>, a cane covered with skin and mounted with precious metals;
this was to test his courage; many other ceremonies were practiced.</p>
<p>The novice being declared a fit candidate for membership, blood was
mixed with aguardiente and drunk by the new member and a wild scene of
revelry wound up the ceremony.</p>
<p>Under the severe laws passed, <i lang=
"es">&Ntilde;a&ntilde;iguismo</i> shrunk to insignificant proportions
and the different chapters were supposed to have been broken up.</p>
<p>During the last few years it has been on the increase, the character
however having somewhat changed.</p>
<p>But little can be learned of this society, at present a recent
criminal cases brought to light the fact that the very rites of
initiation were criminal in their character, a <i>novice</i> in the
society must wound some stranger and drink the flowing blood before the
last rites are administered.</p>
<p>The Society is governed by a King, who is represented in each
district by a &ldquo;<i>Father of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e259"
title="Source: Comunity">Community</span></i>&rdquo; or Chief Doctor,
who has at his command the <i lang="es">Brujos</i> or Conjurors.</p>
<p><i>Santa Baraba</i>, the patron saint of the order is no less than a
savage idol with a Catholic name.</p>
<p>There are annual <i>fiestas</i> in honor of this Saint, where only
members of the Society are admitted, but I was fortunate enough to
witness from a friendly roof the sacred dance and battle with the
devil.</p>
<p>Clothed only in long strings of feathers, the <i lang="es">Brujo</i>
who played the part of &ldquo;leading man&rdquo;, <span class="corr"
id="xd26e280" title="Source: postrated">prostrated</span> himself
before the sacred image and lighted the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e283" title="Source: sacrifical">sacrificial</span> flames.</p>
<p>Goats, black cocks and other animals were brought forward by the
devotees and beheaded. Fruit also was offered.</p>
<p>The nature of the sacrifice most acceptable to the <i lang=
"es">Mabruja</i> is communicated in advance to each of the
Saint&rsquo;s followers, through the medium of the <i lang=
"es">Brujo</i>.</p>
<p>It is certain that most of the time the <i lang="es">exigencias</i>
of the saint do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e301" href=
"#xd26e301" name="xd26e301">6</a>]</span>not pass the sacrifice of a
fat cock, or a goat whose head is consumed by the flames (while the
father of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e303" title=
"Source: comunity">community</span> eats the rest of the victim), but
cases have presented where the dagger or poison, have been ordered to
remove some obstruction from the path of private individuals, whose
money has influenced the saint to decree their death.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e307" title=
"Source: Sacrifical">Sacrificial</span> dances are always at night and
the weird, scantily clad figure of the officiating priest can easily be
likened to that of some demon tending the infernal fires.</p>
<p>After the sacrifice, the low monotonous moaning of the tom-tom
announces that the ball has opened.</p>
<p>Twisting his body in painful contortions, the <i lang="es">brujo</i>
dances about the sacred fire, gaining momentum with each round until he
at last resembles a human pin-wheel; now slower and slower he dances,
scanning the faces of his fear-stricken followers for a victim, until
at last his hypnotic eye fixes upon an aged negress, who falls
screaming to earth in convulsed fear. She is possessed of a <i lang=
"es">Mabruja</i> or Evil Spirit, who has inconsiderately taken
possession of the old lady&rsquo;s person, without her leave, and the
&ldquo;doctor&rdquo; wants to extract it; apparently the operation
becomes painful to the old lady, who would <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e320" title="Source: doubtles">doubtless</span> have much rather
been left in quiet possession of his satanic majesty.</p>
<p>After much man&oelig;uvring, the doctor announces that the
<i>Mabruja</i> was vanquished and has left his country woman, who still
sits in comical amazement where she had fallen; to one who has really
entered the inner life of the country districts of Cuba this is no
strange sight.</p>
<p>One of the most abhorrent practices of witchcraft is the use of Love
Philters composed of ingredients of a nature too horrible to mention.
It is needless to say that this custom is practiced almost solely by
the lowest class of society, but in so great respect and fear are its
results held that almost the first advice one receives on arriving in
Cuba, is to never accept refreshments in a strange house, for fear that
they may contain this concoction; many tales are told of young men who
by means of this drug have been lured into attachment for women of
shady complexion and still more shady reputation.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">Piedra Im&aacute;n</i>, a sort of lodestone, plays
an important part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e335" href=
"#xd26e335" name="xd26e335">7</a>]</span>in the practice of witchcraft;
sacrifices of animals are made to this stone whose absorbent qualities
cause it to greedily suck the blood of the victims. In sickness and
love this stone is always in evidence. Are you dying of unrequited
love? No need to worry while a dozen old witches are aching for the
opportunity of relieving your heart (and pocket). For gold a small
stone will be placed in your possession and if you carefully follow
directions, luck will attend your affairs with Cupid.</p>
<p>To succeed it is necessary to secure a strand of hair (pulled, not
cut) and the parings of your loved one&rsquo;s nails; these are mixed
with steel filings and placed with the &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in a metal
box. On Mondays the &ldquo;stone&rdquo; is strictly teetotal and only
water may be offered, but as Friday draws near, the &ldquo;God&rdquo;

<p>Secure a white child and with the help of a <i lang="es">brujo</i>

<p>It is impossible to dispute the fact of this and other horrible
cannibalistic practices to which the superstitious negros are addicted;

developments of the noted &ldquo;Gabriel Case&rdquo; when a number of
<i lang="es">Brujos</i> were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment

<p>Not only in the greater joys and griefs of life is witchcraft used,
but in the petty <span class="corr" id="xd26e385" title=

<p>The dread combination of sprinkling salt in an old shoe and placing
it upon an upturned broom, has caused many an unwelcome guest to hasten
his departure.</p>
<p>Some of the common superstitions are: never twist an empty
chair.</p>
<p>Never read by the light of two candles; you are mocking death.</p>
<p>A moth flying about you at night means that you are to receive a
letter.</p>
<p>A match which continues burning after being thrown away will bring
you money.</p>
<p>A dog scratching the floor of a house is digging his master&rsquo;s
grave. He will soon die.</p>
<p>If a hearse passes a person twice during the same funeral, he will
be its next occupant.</p>
<p>Never cross the arms over the head; your mother or nearest relation
will die.</p>
<p>Never sweep the crumbs from a table with a paper; it will bring
disgrace to your family.</p>
<p>In former years, when the milk man brought his cows along to town
and milked them before your door, there was a curious belief that if a
cow bawled in front of a house where a sick person lay, that person
would die.</p>
<p>If a mass is not said for the repose of a soul, the newly dead will
come at night and pull the feet or carry off the blanket of the nearest

<p>A black moth flying at night means that there will be a death in the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fortunately for history, most early Spanish
expeditions were <span class="corr" id="xd26e450" title=
"Source: accompannied">accompanied</span> by such observers as Las
Casas, Cort&eacute;s, Gomara and Oviedo, who although differing in
minor details and unreliably eulogistic of their own expeditions and
leaders have agreed on their accounts of the habits of the Indians as
found at the time of the discovery.</p>
<p>Bartolom&eacute; Las Casas in particular made a study of the Indians
and in so far as possible sought to relieve their sufferings.</p>
<p>Separated by but a narrow stretch of water from the other islands of
the West Indies, Cuba was inhabited by an entirely different race of
men. The Caribes, who infested the smaller islands, were a warlike
tribe of anthropophagi who terrorized the shores of Cuba by frequent
and bloody excursions, carrying off many captives for their
cannibalistic feasts.</p>
<p>The Indians of Cuba were of the Siboneyes tribe, excepting those
about Bayamo and Baracoa, who were of the Caribe nation. In
<span class="corr" id="xd26e459" title="Source: there">these</span> two
localities deformed skulls have been found identical with those
collected at Guadalupe, the principal seat of the Caribes.</p>
<p>Several <span class="corr" id="xd26e464" title=
"Source: hypothesis">hypotheses</span> have been given of the origin of
the Siboney Indians. Some writers claim them as descendants of the
Mayas of Yucatan, but Bachiller y Morales disposes this on the radical
difference of the characters of the two tribes. With the exception of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e467" href="#xd26e467" name=
"xd26e467">11</a>]</span>the Floridians and the Araucanians of Chile;
the Siboneyes are unlike all other American Indians.</p>
<p>Abbe Don J. Ignatius Molina writing of the Araucanian about the year
1800 says<span class="corr" id="xd26e471" title="Source: .">,</span>
&ldquo;The natives of this part of the New World being of a mild
character, much resembling that of the Southern <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e474" title="Source: asiatics">Asiatics</span>,&rdquo; and again:
&ldquo;The features of both (hill or plain tribes) are regular; they
have round faces, small animated eyes full of expression, a nose rather
flat, a handsome mouth, even and white teeth, muscular and well shaped
limbs and small flat feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Siboneyes Bachiller y Morales says: &ldquo;They did not
present the robust muscularity of the North American Indian nor did the
expression of their faces assume the bloody instincts of the Caribe. In
color light olive, they were tall straight limbed men of peaceful
disposition who lived mainly by the chase and agriculture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the strength of this resemblance some writers <span class="corr"
id="xd26e481" title="Source: hare">have</span> concluded that the
Siboneyes were descendants of the Araucanians. This disagrees with the
traditions of the Siboneyes themselves who claim to have <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e484" title="Source: inmigrated">immigrated</span> from
Florida; first driving from the island the males of a nation who were
inferior to themselves in number and civilization; <span class="corr"
id="xd26e487" title="Source: morever">moreover</span> the Indians of
Cuba long had tradition of the wonderful land of Cantio or Florida.</p>
<p>Washington Irving in his &ldquo;Spanish Voyages of Discovery&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;The belief of the existence in Florida, of a river like
that sought by Juan Ponce, was long prevalent among the Indians of
Cuba, and the caciques were anxious to discover it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geographical conditions would also favor the theory of the Siboneyes
coming originally from Florida.</p>
<p>Evidence of an earlier race in Cuba has been discovered in the caves
of the eastern part of the island. Skulls differing greatly from both
those of the Siboneyes and Caribes have been found, as well an stone
implements, which most authors agree were not used by the
Siboneyes.</p>
<p>It is probable that the Siboney tradition of their coming originally
from Florida is correct.</p>
<p>At the time of discovery, Cuba was divided politically into thirty
different states as follows:</p>
<p>Sabeneque, Cayaguaya, Manibon, Bani, Barajogua, Sagua, Baracoa on
the north coast; Hanamano, Jagua, Guanjaya, Magon, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e503" href="#xd26e503" name=
"xd26e503">12</a>]</span>Omapai, Guanaros, Cueiba, Cucanajani, Macaca,
Boyuca, Bajatiquiri and Masi on the south coast; Cuanajami,
Guanejuanica, Marien, Habana, and Canauei touching both coasts;
Macoriges, Calacon, Bayamo, Maeye and Cuamaj in the interior.</p>
<p>Each state was independent and was governed by a king or cacique who
<span class="corr" id="xd26e507" title="Source: has">was</span>
absolute ruler of the nation: subject to no laws and holding the power
of life and death over his subjects, this power was seldom used
arbitrarily, the cacique appearing more in the role of a father to his
people.</p>
<p>The subjects of the kingdom were called <i lang="es">tainos</i>
probably signifying citizens or subjects; they were of different rank;
the <i lang="es">naitains</i> or <i lang="es">naitanos</i> formed the
nobility or commanding part, the <i lang="es">naboris</i> or <i lang=

"Source: vassels">vassals</span> or laboring class, who were divided
into different groups, each group under the authority or command of a

<p>As a mark of distinction the nobles wore the hair tied high up on
the head and on feast days adorned themselves with feathers<span class=

The hair of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e539" title=

<p>The national laws were few and severe, theft being the crime most
severely punished.</p>
<p>The convicted thief was <span class="corr" id="xd26e549" title=
"Source: empaled">impaled</span> on a large stick and suspended between
two upright posts until life was extinct.</p>
<p>As among many uncivilized races most of the manual work was
performed by women. Among the <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e555"
title="Source: siboneyes">Siboneyes</span></i> married men were exempt
from agricultural presents, but assisted in gold washing, etc. They
were obliged however, to live separate from their families for some
time before going on a gold hunting expedition.</p>

<p>The primitive Cubans were of an amorous disposition, somewhat
indolent. Polygamy was permitted, but seldom practiced except among the
ruling classes; promiscuous intercourses and unnatural crimes were
ascribed to the <span class="corr" id="xd26e566" title=

gave this as his excuse for the massacres of the entire Indian village

of young girls <span class="corr" id="xd26e576" title=

visitor as a peace offering.</p>
<p>They in common with other West Indian nations had a tradition of the
formation of the world. <i>Lucuo</i> (God) formed the world, we know he
made all things; he came from a country beyond the clouds peopled by
spirits and souls. The world was first formed without mountains or
water, but under the influence of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e584"
title="Source: sen">sea</span> <span class="corr" id="xd26e587" title=

<p><i>Lucuo</i> formed the first man of wheat; when he was finished he
touched the image on the stomach with his foot changing it into two
grand <i>Lucayos</i>, male and <span class="corr" id="xd26e597" title=
"Source: fernale">female</span> to <span class="corr" id="xd26e600"
title="Source: who mnine">whom nine</span> divine offsprings were

<p>The first <i lang="es">Nounm</i> (the moon) was very proud and
boastful of his brilliancy but when <i lang="es">Huin</i> (the sun) was
born and showed his shining face <i lang="es">Nounm</i> became ashamed
and hid himself only coming out at night when <i lang="es">Huin</i> is
absent.</p>
<p>The other offsprings were given charge of the elements.</p>
<p><i lang="es">Cuasima</i> was chief of the <i lang="es">Cemi</i>
inferior gods who were the offsprings of Lucuo and the first woman.</p>
<p>Lucuo lived a long time with his people and taught them the first
principles of agriculture.</p>
<p><a id="xd26e629" name="xd26e629"></a>Taking an old man aside he
buried a stick in the ground and told him to dig in the same place
after nine months had passed; at the end of this period the old man dug
up the place as directed and found yuca growing.</p>
<p>The Behique or doctors of the tribe <span class="corr" id="xd26e633"
title="Source: exected">exerted</span> an important influence. They
were charged with the perpetuation of the nations history or
traditions, which were taught to the children of the nobility in the
form of songs which were chanted by them on feast days.</p>
<p>The Behique was also at the head of their religion. Their prayers
were directed not to the creator by but to the <i lang="es">Mabuya</i>
or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e641" href="#xd26e641" name=
"xd26e641">14</a>]</span>bad spirit their belief being as &ldquo;God is
good it is not necessary to gain his protection; the devil is bad and
it is therefore better for us to adore and propitiate him so that he
will work us no ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their intercessions were made through the medium of the <i lang=
"es">Cemi</i> inferior Gods of whom stone images were erected, and who
acted as messengers to the greater Gods. Each Behique had his own
particular Cemi called Cochexi who was solely at the command of that
special Behique; the Cochexi of some Behique, were regarded as superior
to others. The Cemi also had charge of all natural objects such as the
springs, the rain, thunder, and dew.</p>
<p>Diseases were very rare and also very violent among the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e651" title="Source: Siboneys">Siboneyes</span>; the
Behique cured their followers by medical preparations of herbs and
roots, together with magical symbols and by blowing upon them; after
fasting and pretending to hold direct communication with their
Cemi.</p>
<p>Twice a year great religious feasts were held when the Behiques
fasting weeks in advance living only on the juices of certain grains
appearing weak and <span class="corr" id="xd26e656" title=
"Source: emancipated">emaciated</span>. After the usual sacrifices to
the Cemi they worked themselves into a religious ecstasy; while in this
condition they were questioned on subjects of interest, such as the
probability of war, battles and death, their answers being received as
coming direct from the Gods.</p>
<p>At their fiesta or Gloritas wonderful dances were held several
taking hold of each other&rsquo;s hands then moved themselves to the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e661" title="Source: rymth">rhythm</span> of
a slow chant and the music of the tom-tom, a hollow trunk of a tree
covered by the skin of some wild animal. It was their custom to dance
until so exhausted that they fell to the ground. During the dances wine
was passed from one to another and drunk without spilling or
interrupting the dance. Men and women danced together only on the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e664" title=
"Source: occassion">occasion</span> of a great victory or on the birth
or death of a cacique, when no wine was drunk.</p>
<p>The Siboneyes were armed with the bow and arrow, dart and mace; the
arrow and dart were tipped with fish bones; the mace was a heavy club
made of hardwood and seems to have been their favorite weapon. They
also construed clever traps to <span class="corr" id="xd26e669" title=
"Source: ennare">ensnare</span> game.</p>
<p>They had a <span class="corr" id="xd26e674" title=

Cuba. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e677" href="#xd26e677" name=

<p>Fire was made by rubbing a piece of hard wood between two pieces of
softer wood.</p>
<p>Fishing was one of their pursuits many of the houses of the noble
were built upon piles along the shores of streams; this was probably a
means of securing themselves against surprise by the cannibals.</p>
<p>The hardships to which the Siboneyes were subjected has caused

<h2 class="main">Some Cuban Shrines</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Cuba as in all pro-Catholic countries the natives
have a host of saints to whom they attribute various supernatural
powers; they are held in greater or less esteem according to the
miraculous cures they have achieved or the concessions they have
granted their followers.</p>
<p>Each family or individual has a special saint to whom they appeal in
times of trouble or sickness. Sometimes however when a saint has
repeatedly proved inefficient or has failed to grant the wishes of a
devotee, it is cast aside or exchanged for one that has been
recommended by a friend. It is no unusual thing to hear one lady
advising another to try such and such a saint. &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Rece &aacute; San Jos&eacute;, &eacute;l me ha concedido todo lo
que yo le ped&iacute;</span>&rdquo;. Pray to San Jos&eacute; he grants
all I ask him.</p>
<p>There are also a number of saints who are specially efficient in
certain diseases or conditions. One always prays to San Blas to cure
throat trouble, and young ladies know that San Nicolas with gladly
assist them to secure good (rich) husbands, San Ram&oacute;n protects
them during pregnancy and San L&aacute;zaro during child-birth. Sta.
B&aacute;rbara makes timid hearts brave in times of war; Santo Domingo
cures fever, Santa Lucia looks after the eyes, San Antonio protects
from fire; and so in every case that may be presented there is some
saint (or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e711" href="#xd26e711"
name="xd26e711">17</a>]</span>saintess) who has taken that disease or
ill for their special power of benefaction.</p>
<p>When an article is lost San Antonio de Padua is in disgrace until it
is found. The figure of the saint is placed head-down-wards and if some
time elapses without the lost object being recovered the image is bound
to a chair back and severely whipped for failing in his duty; if the
lost object still remains undiscovered the infant which always
accompanies the saint is cut away from the image and the following
couplet repeated</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;San Antonio Bendito</p>
<p class="line">si no me concedes lo que te pido</p>
<p class="line">no te devuelvo tu ni&ntilde;o.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Blessed San Antonio if you do not grant what I
ask, I will not return your child&rdquo; this last resource rarely
fails in causing the recovery of whatever is missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="es">El Se&ntilde;or Milagroso</span>&rdquo; the
miracle worker, is an image treasured as one of the most valued
religious <span class="corr" id="xd26e729" title=
"Source: possesion">possession</span> of Matanzas. Although the church
has offered many thousands of dollars for its possession, and its owner
is in comparatively poor <span class="corr" id="xd26e732" title=
"Source: circunstances">circumstances</span>, it still remains in the
hands of a private family.</p>
<p>It has been handed down through many generations of the Castro
family and is at present in the possession of Sr. Arturo Castro who has
built a shrine where all are welcome to visit and revere the saint.</p>
<p>This saint is supposed to instantly answer the prayer of those who
are in great danger. A curious story is connected with the image of a
snake twined about the body of a man that is placed before in the
saint.</p>
<p>During the revolution of 1868 when many well to do families were
temporarily reduced to needy <span class="corr" id="xd26e741" title=
"Source: circunstances">circumstances</span> an old man was accustomed
to visit his married son about the time of the mid-day meal. The son
who found it difficult to fill the all too many mouths of his own
household one day ordered the meal to be kept back until his father had
gone. The father came and failing to see the usual preparations for
breakfast in progress inquired if the meal had already been served, he
was given to understand that it had and left the house somewhat nettled
as was natural. The dish was now ordered to be placed on the table with
the least possible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e744" href=
"#xd26e744" name="xd26e744">18</a>]</span>delay. As moments passed and
no food appeared the master of the house went to the kitchen to inquire
the causes of delay and there found the servant struggling to lift the
cover from a kettle. Angry at the inability to perform so apparently
simple a task he gave the cover a pull &hellip; and then slowly from
the boiling liquid appeared the shining coils of a monstrous serpent,
which wound itself <span class="corr" id="xd26e746" title=
"Source: aboutthe">about the</span> body of the selfish son! &hellip;
imagine the confusion and consternation in which the household was
thrown on seeing their master in the coils of this huge monster.</p>
<p>The master finding it impossible to release himself from the coils
of the serpent and realising that this was the punishment of God for
deceiving his parent vowed to present the <span lang="es">Se&ntilde;or
Milagroso</span> a silver image of the incident.</p>
<p>El Santo Sudario is a saint out-lawed and unrecognized by the
authorities of the church; persons found wearing the reliquary
containing the prayer to the saint are accounted rebels against the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e757" title="Source: churchand">church
and</span> are <span class="corr" id="xd26e760" title=
"Source: excomunicated">excommunicated</span>.</p>
<p>This saint is the patron of robbers and <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e765" title="Source: assasins">assassins</span>, and of people who
are in constant danger of death by violence or drowning.</p>
<p>El Santo Sudario or Just Judge protects its followers against fire,
wild animals, bullets<span class="corr" id="xd26e770" title=
"Source: ;">,</span> death by drowning, and hanging, it is in great
request by soldiers or sailors.</p>
<p>During the Spanish regime in Cuba it became a misdemeanor to have an
image of the saint in one&rsquo;s <span class="corr" id="xd26e775"
title="Source: possesion">possession</span> it being believed by the
authorities that it gave criminals <span class="corr" id="xd26e778"
title="Source: inmunity">immunity</span> against detection or
arrest.</p>
<p>A laughable accident in connection with the saint happened to the
knowledge of the writer. During the last political unpleasantness an
officer of the government forces was pressed to accept a present of a
reliquary of El Santo Sudario to protect him against the dangers of
battle <span class="corr" id="xd26e783" title=
"Source: uncredulous">incredulous</span> of its power but willing to
please his friend he accepted the gift and placed it about his neck.
The <span class="corr" id="xd26e786" title=
"Source: reliquiary">reliquary</span> encased in a red silk bag to
prevent its chafing the skin was soon forgotten.</p>
<p>While taking account of the casualties after a very active skirmish
the officer was astonished and somewhat frightened to have his
attention called to an apparently severe wound he himself had received
in the breast. <span class="corr" id="xd26e791" title=
"Source: Glacing">Glancing</span> down sure enough a huge stain of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e794" href="#xd26e794" name=
"xd26e794">19</a>]</span>blood had appeared on the front of his
uniform. Feeling no pain and the wound appearing in such a vital place
the officer imagined himself booked for the long voyage. Frantically
tearing open his clothing in haste to stop the bleeding he found to his
surprise that the red silk bag, containing the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e796" title="Source: reliquia">reliquary</span> was dripping
<a id="xd26e799" name="xd26e799"></a>with <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e801" title="Source: pispiration">perspiration</span> and had run
through his clothing.</p>
<p>The Shrine of La Santa Imagen in the Hermitage of Monserrat,
Matanzas, is the Mecca of the Spanish residents of Cuba, who
<span class="corr" id="xd26e806" title=
"Source: anually">annually</span> in the 8th of November journey from
all parts of the Island to attend the fiesta of Monserrat.</p>
<p>This saint is supposed to have the power to grant three wishes to
those who fulfill their vows during the year. The many offerings of
gold and silver about the altar offer eulogiastic proof of the faith
and esteem in which the saint <span class="corr" id="xd26e811" title=
"Source: in">is</span> regarded. These objects are vowed to the saint
in times of sickness or <span class="corr" id="xd26e814" title=
"Source: dispair">despair</span> and usually take the form of a
miniature representative of the parts of the body that are made well by
the intercession of the saint.</p>
<p>Vows of humility are also made to the saint. One devout more
believer has passed the whole of each fiesta on his knees for than 20
years, in fulfillment of a vow made when he received intelligence of a
fatal accident to his only daughter that happened while he was far from
home. He vowed to the Holy Image that if he were allowed to reach the
bedside of the child before she passed away he would perform this act
of humility as long as <span class="corr" id="xd26e819" title=
"Source: the">he</span> lived in gratitude for the saint&rsquo;s
intercession in his behalf.</p>
<p>For some special favor shown young girls will promise Our Lady
Carmelo to use no other dress for a certain period than that prescribed
by the Order of the Sisters of Carmelo, a dusty brown with black
girdle.</p>
<p><span lang="es">La Se&ntilde;ora del Cobre</span> is the patron
saint of Cuba. This saint is a wooden image placed on El Cobre hill
near Santiago of Cuba.</p>
<p>This Image has a touch of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e831"
title="Source: wanderbust">wanderlust</span> often disappearing during
the night and returning, covered with sand and sea weed. Once some
accident befell it and it was picked far out at sea by a fishing boat
and returned to its place.</p>
